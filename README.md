Data Extraction: The project begins by scraping cricket data from reliable web sources to acquire a comprehensive dataset of players' World Cup T20 2022 performance.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: The extracted data is processed and refined using Python's pandas library. This ensures the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

Data Modeling with DAX: The project employs Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create data models allowing advanced analysis and calculations. DAX enables us to build parameters and measures that facilitate insightful player comparisons.

Insightful Visualization: Utilized a range of filters to assess players and identify the most exceptional among them. These filters include batting average, bowling economy, and more. Top players are categorized into key performance areas: openers, middle-order batsmen, finishers, all-rounders, and fast bowlers.

Best XI Selection: By carefully considering the insights generated through data analysis and visualization, we identify the best combination of players for each key performance category to form the ultimate World Cup T20 2022 Best XI.
